## Features
* **Quantum-Resistant Security:** We use the latest NIST-standardized PQC algorithmsâ€”Kyber (for encryption), Dilithium, and SPHINCS+ (for digital signatures)â€”to protect your financial data from future quantum attacks.
* **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** Our system goes beyond traditional authentication. It uses a real-time ML engine to analyze user behavior (like typing patterns) and continuously scores the trustworthiness of a session. This allows us to detect and block threats like spoofing and identity manipulation instantly.
* **High Performance:** Built with Rust, our cryptographic services are optimized for speed, ensuring low latency and high throughput. The system is benchmarked to handle over 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining security.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed with a modular, containerized architecture, our solution can be easily plugged into your existing infrastructure. The system is built with Rust, Python and Java (Spring Boot) and provides clean, API-driven interfaces for simple deployment.
* **Compliance-Ready:** We built this system with regulatory requirements in mind. It aligns with key frameworks like PCI DSS 4.0, NIST PQC migration guidelines, and ENISA recommendations, making your path to compliance smoother.
* **Agility and Resilience:** The hybrid design allows for flexible fallback to classical cryptography or alternative PQC algorithms, providing a robust and adaptable security framework. It can be dynamically configured in response to new threats.
* **Key Management:** A dedicated Key Management System (KMS) handles the full lifecycle of PQC keys, including automated rotation and detailed audit logging, which is essential for security and compliance.
* **Transparent and Auditable:** The ML engine includes explainability features to help you understand why a session was flagged as a risk. All cryptographic events are logged for full traceability and audit support.

## Why We Stand Out
* **Holistic Threat Protection:** We don't just solve the quantum threat; we also address the immediate, real-world risks of behavioral spoofing and phishing. This dual-layered approach provides complete protection.
* **Practical & Deployable:** Our MVP isn't just a proof of conceptâ€”it's a production-ready system. We've conducted rigorous load testing and threat modeling to ensure it performs under realistic constraints.
* **Designed for the Financial Sector:** The system's architecture, from the use of enterprise-grade Java/Spring Boot to its compliance-focused features, is tailored to the specific needs and challenges of financial institutions.
* **Future-Proof:** Our use of hybrid cryptography and a modular design ensures that the system can evolve. It's ready for future cryptographic standards and new types of behavioral threats.
